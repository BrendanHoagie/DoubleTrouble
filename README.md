# DoubleTrouble
A version of the game of Nim, based on the board game Double Trouble. There are three piles, one of 3 tokens, one of 5 tokens, and one of 7 tokens. On each turn, take as many tokens from a single row as you like. The objective is to take the final token from the game board. Play in either single player mode, against a computer opponent that plays with perfect strategy, or in multiplayer mode.
